CS-340-T4528 Client/Server Development 22EW4

How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

In order to create software that is easily mainntained, you have to make sure the entire software is interchangable with the project so you can constantly update each module like I did in this project from time to time. This increases the time it takes to get done.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

As a Computer Scientist, I use a bunch of thinking. You constantly have to make sure your code is correct and you understand what needs to get done and what the requirements are. Solutions are a huge part of this as well and making sure you can get passed challenging parts is a plus.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer Scientists create code, programs, applications, debug them and more. They constantly test and create and deliver products to people. Without them we wouldn't have most apps we have today. Like Grazioso Salvare you can replace the code constantly to ensure a faster coding process.
